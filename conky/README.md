# Conky Configs

## Setup

Edit the configuration files, replacing {device} and {path} tags with the
informationf or the system. Edit the CPU percentages file and the temperatures
file, making sure the number of cores is correct and that the processor model
sed commands are correct.

Place the configs in yoru conky configuration path. If you want to script the
startup of conky, place the conky-start bash script in your `$PATH` after
editing it to contain the paths for your system.
